            <h2>CS61B Database</h2>
            <p>
                A relational database management system that I created with Java that can store multiple types of data
                in tables. I also built a domain specific language similar to the SQL language to interact with the database.

            <h2>BearMaps</h2>
            <p>
                A map of the UC Berkeley campus that I created with Java using a QuadTree data structure. I also implemented
                A* in order to find the shortest path between two locations on the map.

            <h2>SIXT33N Car</h2>
            <p>
                A miniature car that can obey certain voice commands. I constructed a front-end circuit accompanied with
                a mic circuit board that converts sound to a controlled signal. I also programmed an MSP430 Launchpad with
                Arduino code to perform principal component analysis to classify voice commands and to control the actions of the car.

            <h2>Loop Pedal</h2>
            <p>
                A project I worked on during CalHacks 3.0 where my group and I created an iOS application
                that records sound files and combines them in a loop. All recording is controlled by a
                bluetooth-linked Arduino by a switch on a circuit. You can view the project
                <a class="link" href="https://github.com/lawrencechen14/LoopPedal" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h2>Bear's Sunlight Clock</h2>
            <p>
                A project I worked on during Iot Hacks where my group and I created an alarm clock with LEDs
                to imitate sunlight. We programmed an Arduino with C++ so that it activates the LEDs at a specified
                time and linked the Arduino to a website through WiFi module to get the time.

            <p>
                I'm planning to work on plenty of cool new projects soon, so feel free to follow my progress on
                <a class="link" href="https://github.com/lawrencechen14" target="_blank">Github</a>!
